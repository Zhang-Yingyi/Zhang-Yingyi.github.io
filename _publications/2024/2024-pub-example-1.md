  In this paper, we investigate how to improve the large language model (LLM) in the user behavior alignment task, which is constrained by input confusion and process uncertainty. We propose a novel framework that employs input-level model cooperation and model-level parameter optimization. Specifically, in input-level model cooperation, we use the small language models to provide supplementary information to the LLM from both chain-of-thought and semantic similarity perspectives. In model-level parameter optimization, we first use data selection methods to train different models and then hybridize them to obtain the best one. The proposed framework was verified in the KDD Cup 2024 and achieved rank-2 performance, with code open-sourced at here.
