## About Me

I am now a fourth-year PhD candidate at the joint program between Dalian University of Technology (DUT) and City University of Hong Kong (CityU). And I am jointly supervised by [Prof. Xianneng Li](https://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/li/zh_CN/index.htm) (at DUT) and [Prof. Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) (at CityU). Before that, I graduated from DUT with a bachelor’s degree in Information Management and Information Systems in 2020. My interests lie in Personalized Recommender System, Personalized RAG, and Personalized LLM.
